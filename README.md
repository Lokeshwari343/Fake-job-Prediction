## Problem
Scammers advertise jobs the same way legitimate employers do — online (in ads, on job sites, and social media), in newspapers, and sometimes on TV and radio. They promise you a job, but what they want is your money and your personal information.

## Model Description 
Fake-Job-Predictor is a python based machine learning model, which uses algorithms like the Naive Bayes algorithm and Decision tree classifier algorithm, to predict whether a posted job is fake or real. 

Code for all the detailed analysis and model building can be viewed [here](Fake_job_predictor.ipynb).

## Model Evaluation 

### Naive Bayes Approach 
In the first approach, Multinomial Naive Bayes,which is one of the most popular supervised learning classifications was used for the analysis of the categorical text data. <br>
Classification Accuracy: 0.8980769230769231 <br>
Confusion Matrix:

In the Second approach, Decision tree classifier was used which classifies inputs by segmenting the input space into regions. <br>
Classification Accuracy: 0.8173076923076923 <br>
